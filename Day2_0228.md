## Exodus 14 - 16

In chapter 14, it's basically the most well-known part of the whole Exodus story, Crossing the Red Sea. To be honest the part that touched me the most is still the thing we discussed yesterday -- **"Bestfriendness"**.

> **Exodus 14:13-15**
>
> 13 Moses answered, "Don't be afraid! Stand your ground, and you will see what the Lord will do to save you today; you will never see these Egyptians again.
>
> 14 The Lord will fight for you, and there is no need for you to do anything."
>
> 15 The Lord said to Moses, "Why are you crying out for help? Tell the people to move forward."

What do you see from the Bible verses up there? I guess you wouldn't see what I saw. Did you notice that when Moses first encouraged the Israelites he said, **"Don't be afraid!"** but in verse 15,
the Lord said to Moses, **"Why are you crying out for help?"**. If Moses was not afraid, why would he cry out to God?
What I saw is that, being a leader, many of the times we have to be strong, we have no room to be timid. Because we are the examples of our sheeps, they look up to us and if we allow ourselves to be weak, they see it too, and they will imitate it.
But God knows every deepest little thoughts in our hearts, even just for a moment we thought to ourselves that we wanted to quit, he knows it.
No one can "act" perfect before God, he knows our needs. That is the greatest of all things when God is with us, he never overlook our needs like humans did.
I believe that is one of the secrets to why Moses can be such best friends with God for so long time, this is what I have to learn to appreciate, it's **Every Little Things**.
He take cares of **Every Little Things** in our life, just as the song **_Every Little Things_**

There is another part in the Bible that I read which touched me too, in Chapter 16, verse 16 through 35, it is all talking about the Providence God had given to the Israelites -- **Manna and the Quails**.

> **Exodus 16:16**
>
> ... two litres for each member of his household."

It says here in verse 16, every household is to only collect 2 litres of the dew that suddenly appeared all around the camp, which can be then cooked into Manna. But some of the Israelites did not listen, they gathered more and store it in their house. But something they found out is that the next day these extra dew collected eventually evaporated and those been cooked into Manna melted and fill with worms.
This is the evidence that God is the one that provides them will all these food and not their luckiness that brought them to find food in the wilderness.

> **Exodus 16:22**
>
> On the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, four litres for each person. ...

This is what specials for the Sabbath, God prepared food for the Israelites as on the Sabbath, they are not to work. In contrast, now in this society people seems to care less about Sabbath day, the society nowadays is always so busy and fast running, and this is exactly why we need to follow the Sabbath even more.
Else, we will only observe ourselves like a servant that work non-stop and doesn't even know which direction we are going. It is very important that in our daily lives, we sit down silently and come close to God, seperate a **"Sabbath time"** that we can put down our work, let our mind fully focus on God. You know even one of the richest person in the World, Bill Gates. He is a Jew and the culture of Sabbath is deep within him, he follows this rule and success, though he didn't use this rule to come near to God, he called it the "The Thinking Week" where he seperated himself out for a week and just enjoy the silent moment and reflect.
This seems worldly, but ask ourselves this question, how often do we really sit down with nothing to worry in our mind, that we are fully focused in communicating to our God?
Sabbath is not about the rule, just like what Jesus had said in the Gospel, Sabbath is about the relationship, that is what makes Sabbath important, not the rule but the relationship.

This prayer marathon is really a reminder for me to _Transform_ myself in terms of my daily lives to include the godly culture that God had taught us in the Bible.
