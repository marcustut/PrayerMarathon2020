## Exodus 1 - 13

This is the story where God helped his people out of the land of slavery. 

The thing that I see today is the **"Bestfriendess"** between Moses and the Lord.
Though Moses is the chosen one but he is not perfect, he started his calling only at the age of 80.
Not like me, I am lucky that God you called me to you at the age of 13 
and I started to serve you so soon just after I was saved, this is my honour.
In my personal view, I think the best thing is that Moses had a promise 
from God, where God told him that he will always be with him.

>**Exodus 3:11 - 12**<br>
>11 But Moses said to God, "I am nobody. How can I go to the king and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"<br>
>12 God answered, "I will be with you, and when you bring the people out of Egypt, you will worship me on this mountain. That will be the proof that I have sent you."

In Chapter 3, where Moses met the Lord at the burning bush, I can see that actually Moses is a timid and scared man.
But it's amazing how when he started this **"Bestfriendess"** relationship with God. 
Everything has changed. It's not that he doesn't scare but God is always there to cover him. He has this assurance deep down in his Heart. 
And I believe this is what in the end led him to become one of the best men History has seen.

This is just like how God had brought me out few years back, God promised that he will be with me, 
and yes indeed, he is always there but recently I found out that this **"Bestfriendess"** which used to be always between me and God had 
somehow get faded overtime. I really thanks God that he reminded me this today, 
it's not an easy thing to build it back up again, but I believed it's going to be a another story of me and God. 
I will learn to be like Moses, no matter how, I will stay strong and rely on God, I am not perfect, instead I am far from perfect, I know a perfect God and he is my best friend! 
How amazing is that! The encounter with God at the burning bush of my life, I think it would the part where I was in Peacehaven few years back when God showed me a sneak peak of how my life will come down in the Future. 
God thanks for that, but I want more! In this upcoming "Transform" camp, bring me deeper, let me get closer to you that, I don't to become a 'visionful' person that produce no fruit.
I don't want to be a person that talks much but accomplish less. Let me be a wise man in your Words and a man that represents you just like David. 
I do not know where God you will lead me to in the Future as in the aspect of Media and Tech, but God you will surely make into your leader to lead 300. This is your promise to me and I will hold on to it until it happens.
That's all for today, thanks God! I look forward to listen from you tomorrow, my best friend!
