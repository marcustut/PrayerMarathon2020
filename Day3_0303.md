## Exodus 17 - 21

Continue from Chapter 16 last week, Chapter 17 is about **Water from the Rock**. This furthers my emotions, "why is Israelite so stubborn?". Just from the previous chapter, we saw that the Israelite is actually living in miracles every day, where God provided their everyday needs(manna) including their desire to eat meat(quails). It is clearly a miracle which there are just too many obvious evidences recorded in the Bible. But now when there is no water for them, they just kept on complaining. Since they've already know that God can do miracles, why can't they just pray earnestly to the Lord for their needs instead? To give you a clear illustration, this is like your friend "belanja" you lunch every day and you still complain to him "ei, I am thirsty why didn't you buy me drinks?". This is ridiculous!

Nonetheless, Moses accepted these complains from the people, and he brought these to God in an earnest prayer. Though, what I see here is Moses shared the same feeling with God.

> **Exodus 17:4**
> 4 Moses prayed earnestly to the Lord and said, =="What can I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me."==

Moses had this emotion where he felt like he do not know what to do anymore with these Israelite, which at some point God also felt the same, that's why in the end God waited 40 years for the OGs(Old Generation) to go away. This is another example that I find that how **Best Friends** are like, **Best Friends** feel the same way. In simpler words, Moses felt what God felt. This is a characteristics which a lot of great men in the Bible has, for example Samuel, David and also most if not all of the prophets.

This is also one of the things that I have to learn, as a leader of a connect group, we are used to follow our feelings/wisdom to lead the people. Well, I would not say that it is incorrect as there are still times we have to use wisdom to manage the group and also to arrange meetings/outings. But actually the most important thing as a pastoral leader, is to lead our people to God and lead them to experience God in their lives personally. We can't do this without sharing the same insights with God. It means to see our people not with our own eyes but see them from God's perspective(spiritual eyes). People may lose hope, but in God, the end of our ways, is the beginning of his miraculous ways.

Moreover, feeling what God feels is also the only way where we are able to adopt the heart for lost souls. Because God's heart is for the lost souls, without feeling his heart, there's no way to feel the lost souls. We may have the sympathy towards people but it is not the same as feeling the urge to bring someone to Christ when you know one day he dies and eventually go to hell. You are so desperate that you kept on praying and kept on speaking gospel to the person even if he rejects you every time.

> **Exodus 18:16-17**
> 16 When two people have a dispute, they come to me, ==and I decide which one of them is right, and I tell them God's commands and laws."==
> 17 ==Then Jethro said, "You are not doing it the right way.==

Here shows the other attributes of Moses that I should learn, ==use authority correctly== and ==humble==. Using authority correctly is one of the hardest thing for me, I find it very often that when I speak, not so much people would give me respect. Moses knows clearly the authority that God had given him and he used it correctly to solve the disputes among Israelite, also because he used his God-given authority correctly, people respected him and followed him wherever he led them to.

Although it seems like Moses is a person in the top level but on the other hand, he is a very humble person before God and his leaders. He accepts criticism from his father-in-law, Jethro which ends up to be his greatest advice of all time. If it wasn't of the action that he took after taking that advice to appoint leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, I honestly think that Moses would have died a lot sooner due to the pressure of his work.

Being a great leader doesn't mean to be ignorant, but to humble ourselves before God and take in good advices, and be flexible to change.

Well, before going to the camp, I have already found so many flaws in my life when I put myself in the Bible. It is a good news though, now I know where I should work on.
