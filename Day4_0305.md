<p>Before getting into the Bible verses, there is one “rhema” that I want to write it down. I received this when I prayed after reading the Bible. Often, God is the one that understand our needs and fulfill our needs, but isn’t it will be a bit too selfish if we just keep receiving and receiving from God? Therefore, I told myself, I want to go and understand God’s needs and fulfill his needs, fulfill what his heart desires just like what best friends would do.</p>
<h3 id="exodus-22---26">Exodus 22 - 26</h3>
<p>Today’s sharing would be short compared to previous notes. From Chapters 22 until Chapters 26 it’s all about the “rules &amp; regulations” God had set for the Israelite, personally I don’t find interest in reading them, it made me sleepy. 😅</p>
<p>Anyways, I still learned one thing by reading through these “boring” chapters. First thing first, let’s see how “boring” it is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exodus 25:10-12</strong><br>
10 "Make a box out of acacia wood, 110 centimetres long, 66 centimertres wide, and 66 centimetres high.<br>
11 Cover it with pure gold inside and out and put a gold border all round it.<br>
12 Make four carrying rings of gold for it and attach them to its four legs, with two rings on each side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine thousands of sentences are like this and you read through them. Nonetheless, I saw something when I bump into this verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exodus 24:15-18</strong><br>
15 Moses went up Mount Sinai, and a cloud covered it.<br>
16-17 The dazzling light of the Lord’s presence came down on the mountain. To the Israelites the light looked like a fire burning on top of the mountain. The cloud covered the mountain for six days, and on the seventh day the Lord called to Moses from the cloud.<br>
18 Moses went on up the mountain into the cloud. There he stayed for 40 days and nights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, another miraculous encounter with God for Moses and for all of Israel. It was quite bizarre when I imagined the scenario where this took place. There was fire burning on top of a mountain and cloud covered the mountain and our leader went into it for 40 days and nights without any information passing back to the camp. If I was an Israelite back then, I would be worried to death, I would have thought that Moses was dead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exodus 24:12</strong><br>
12 The Lord said to Moses, “Come up the mountain to me, and while you are here, I will give you two stone tablets which contain all the laws that I have written for the instruction of the people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But instead, after 40 days Moses came down with 2 stone tablets which contain all the laws that God had instructed the people. I wonder what happened in those 40 days, did Moses eat? Did he drank any water? Never mind, it’s not the point. But what I saw in this verse is that, after the Lord brought Israelite out of Egypt, provided them food, water and everything they needed, it is time for the Israelite to return something to God. Therefore, Moses being the representative of all Israelite, he went on up to Mount Sinai and spent 40 days and nights in God’s presence to understand what his heart desires. Afterwards, he brought them down and asked the nation to do accordingly to what God’s desires, it is like a time for the Israelite to return little thing that they can do to God.</p>
<p>To put it in picture, it’s just like God brought us out to plant churches and he did provided everything we need in the past two years. Now, it’s time for us to go and understand God’s heart and fulfill his Heart. This upcoming camp is the perfect time to be like Moses going up Mount Sinai and understand God’s heart.</p>
